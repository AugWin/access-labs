Lab 3: Server-Side Single Sign-On
=====================================

The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate Single Sign-On capabilities
of APM.    The SSO Credential Mapping action enables users to forward
stored user names and passwords to applications and servers automatically,
without having to input credentials repeatedly.   This allows single
sign-on (SSO) functionality for secure user access.  As different applications
and resources support different authentication mechanisms, the SSO system
may be required to store and transform credentials to meet these requirements.
For example, username and password may be transformed into forms-based
authentication, a SAML assertion into Kerberos or Kerberos authentication into
SAML.

Although a number of different SSO methods exist, this lab will demonstrate access
single SSO method, the Kerberos to SAML method.

Objective:

-  Gain an understanding of SSO Token User Name Caching and SSO Token Password
   Caching.

-  Gain an understanding of the Kerberos to SAML relationship and its
   component parts.

-  Develop an awareness of the different deployment models that Kerberos
   to SAML authentication opens up

Lab Requirements:

-  All Lab requirements will be noted in the tasks that follow

Estimated completion time: 15 minutes
